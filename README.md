### [Happy Software Developers Solve Problems Better](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3961150/)

What's interesting about this article is that it brings a psychological perspective into software engineering, and highlights that happier software deelopers perform better on analytical problem-solving tasks. Instead of relying on intuition or workplace anecdotes, the authors of the article measure the developers' states by using validated psychology scales and connect them to a developer's performance on a standardized cognitive task (the Tower of London). The authors note that positie mood correlates with stronger analytical reasoning, indicating that a developer's well-being is a factor that can directly influence development outcomes.
